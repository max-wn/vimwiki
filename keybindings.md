## my keybindings

The `MODKEY` is set to the (`Mod4`), this is `Super key` (aka the `Windows
key`). I try to keep the keybindings consistent with all of my programms.

Keybinding | Action
--- | ---
`MODKEY + RETURN` | opens terminal (alacritty is the terminal but can be easily changed)
`MODKEY + SHIFT + RETURN` | toggle split window
`MODKEY + TAB` | rotates through the available layouts
`MODKEY + SPACE` | rotates through the available window
`MODKEY + q` | kill focus window
`MODKEY + r` | start a little prompt in the bar so users can run arbitrary commands (it could be dmenu)
`MODKEY + CONTROL + r` | restarts qtile
`MODKEY + SHIFT + q` | quits qtile
`MODKEY + 1-9` | switch focus to workspace (1-9)
`MODKEY + SHIFT + 1-9` | send focused window to workspace (1-9)
`MODKEY + j` | lazy layout up (switches focus between windows in the stack)
`MODKEY + k` | lazy layout down (switches focus between windows in the stack)
`MODKEY + SHIFT + j` | lazy layout shuffle\_up (rotates the windows in the stack)
`MODKEY + SHIFT + k` | lazy layout shuffle\_down (rotates the windows in the stack)
`MODKEY + h` | expand size of window (MondadTall layout)
`MODKEY + l` | shrink size of window (MondadTall layout)
