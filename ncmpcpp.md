## ncmpcpp

Ncmpcpp is an [mpd](mpd.md) client (compatible with mopidy) with a UI very similar to ncmpc, but it provides new useful features such as support for regular expressions for library searches, extended song format, items filtering, the ability to sort playlists, and a local filesystem browser.

To use it, a functional [mpd](mpd.md) must be present on the system since ncmpcpp/mpd work together in a client/server relationship.
