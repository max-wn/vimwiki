## security advices

You do know about the military data classification/clearance scheme, right?
Data can be classified as

- unclassified,
- confidential,
- secret,
- top secret.

Users have clearance levels: secret, top secret. (It's actually a little more
complicated than this, but let's go with this simple explanation for now).
Users who have a secret clearance may read a document if a) the document is
classified as secret or lower, and b) a need to know (that is, it's important
to his/her job). A user with a secret clearance cannot read any document
classified as top secret.  Users with a top secret clearance can read data
classified as secret and top secret (as long as they have a need to know).
This type of access control (called mandatory access control) is an important
means of ensuring the confidentially and integrity of the data.
